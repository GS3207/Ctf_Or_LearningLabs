Description says its in the cookie 
Using burp to intercept
2 cookies 1 for session 1 for tracking ID
No need to mess with the session
Only use the tracking id
Send the intercepted packet to the repeater
Using the SQL cheat sheet https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet
Just to check which version is being used I'll try MySQL first
'SELECT IF(1=0,(SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables),'a') 
Since its an error based I'm giving a false condition to see if an error pops up
Gave an error
Tried 1=1 also gave an error
Trying oracle now
'SELECT CASE WHEN (1=0) THEN to_char(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual
1=0 no error
1=1 error
its using oracle
Now to check for the parameters to get admin password
'UNION	SELECT CASE WHEN (SUBSTR(password,1,1)< 'a') THEN to_char(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM users where username='administrator' --
>a gives an error now moving to intruder
Set it to sniper and make the $a$ as the attack and payload numbers and lowercase and uppercase letters
got an error at h
do it with the next letter with password,2,1 and so on
h29aah96srjkbk2t7ypi
on 21 i got null as status 500 which was an error
so the above was the password
administrator as username and solved
Sniper needs to be used more doing manually with the > < is too much even with binary search method
