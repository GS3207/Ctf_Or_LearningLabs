Need to check how canonical tags work
No search bar in this lab
Only entry point will be via comments but that is stored
Maybe its the cookie
Only session is available doesn't look injectable
Maybe its the url with the post id
Not with post id that's more towards sqli
?%27accesskey=%27x%27onclick=%27alert(1)
solved the lab ? serves as an additional get parameter
<link rel="canonical" href='https://ac1b1f781eab33f78021100a00e700fa.web-security-academy.net/?'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1)'/>
this is what the injected payload looks like in the source
