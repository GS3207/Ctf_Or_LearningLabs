Again first things look like point of entry is search bar however it could be something else considering an added vector
Custom tags and img tags cause an error saying tags not allowed
Some tags may work so using burp suite intruder tab to check which ones give a 200 status
The a,animate,discard,image,svg,title tag gave a 200 status
Search also happened
Trying with image src displays an empty box not clickable
Trying another intruder with a to see if any events work
None work with image src= the search doesn't filter it
<a target="alert(1)"> didnt work
download didnt work
trying with svg
<svg><a><animate attributeName=href values=javascript:alert(1) /><text x=20 y=20>Click me</text></a>
