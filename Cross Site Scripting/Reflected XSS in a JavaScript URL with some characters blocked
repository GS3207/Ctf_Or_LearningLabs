onerror is probably the way to go
/?%27onerror=alert;throw%201337\\
this did nothing
no clue what to do so checked the solution that decoded to this 
post?postId=5&'},x=x=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window+'',{x:'
post is the file where the parameters are sent
postId is one parameter with value 5
the & creates another parameter with name '},x and value as
x=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window+'',{x:'
x=>{} in javascript means it is a function that has the parameter x
the varaible '},x stores the value of the function
In js the , is used to separate expressions solved left to right and the value of the last one is returned
the first one creates an error with the alert(1337) when an error is found
next x passes through the toString function
window+'' makes it a string lastly 
The last part of the payload {x:' completes the remaining JavaScript code '}.finally
