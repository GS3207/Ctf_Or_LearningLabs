These attributes are the user, and group attributes resepectively. Recall that we can edit the permissions for these attributes, so it stands to reason that we can also change these attributes. That is done using the chown command, which allows us to change the user and group for any file. The syntax for this command is chown user:group file. For example if we wanted to change the owner of file to shiba2 as well as the group to shiba2, we could use
chown shiba2:shiba2 file.
