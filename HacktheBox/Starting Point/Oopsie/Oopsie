Connected to Openvpn
pinged 10.10.10.28
ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.10.10.28 | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//) 
This line essentially stores the ports that are active
grep matches those lines only that are not just single numbers
cuts up the nmap result into components with the delimiter to just just port numbers
replaces new line with a comma and replaces ,$ with a blank
This gives the ports in the format of port1,port2,port3
nmap -sC -sV -p$ports 10.10.10.28
Searches nmap scanner on the ip with the ports we found active
Found two services
Open SSH and Apache
22 and 80 
Checking to see if that version of Open SSH is exploitable
openssh 7.6.p1 
Did find one on Exploit DB that enumerates Username however it just checks if username is there or not
While I was waiting for metasploit to install I wanted to check if the Apache one was exploitable
Apache httpd 2.4.29
There is a vulnerablity CVE-2019-0211
Considering it was an apache website I tried to open it on firefox
Nothing much just a static website
however there is an email at the bottom with the name admin maybe thats a user on the server.
Will try the openssh exploit to see if that is one 
CVE:
2018-15473
It was giving false positives showing admin and other random as verified will try another exploit
Will try it on msf to see if that works
This worked admin was not found
Checking root,administrator also not found
Found a wordlist of common service accounts that didnt work either
Came across nitko to scan the apache server
Found a CGI directory
This gave a login page
Gobuster was used to enumerate what other directories there could be
Reusing the password from Archetype 
MEGACORP_4dm1n!!

accounts tab id is changed
Used that id 86575 was able to get into upload section
Uploaded the php reverse shell to get a shell back
Changed the host ip my vms 
Going to 
url/uploads/name-of-file-uploaded 
activated the shell
Used the walkthrough code
SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null
Ctrl-Z
stty raw -echo
fg
reset
xterm
Shell sets the preffered compiler Makes it bash
script sends the log to the black hole '/dev/null'
stty changes terminal behaviour
raw makes it ignore ctrlz /ctrl c commands
-echo disables echo
fg makes it run in the foreground
reset resetst the terminal 
xterm launches a terminal for an x window system
