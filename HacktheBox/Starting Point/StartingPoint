It was to download and install a vm
Then to download a connection pack to get into that network
Keeping that running using OPEN VPN
New tab I ran the nmap and port scan
Took quite some time
I know nmap at times is slow but could be more so because of the vm
Using the smb client downloaded the config file
Installing impacket was a big headache had to download pip3 and python3
apt get update was needed as well

Rest of it I just followed instructions
Impacket wasnt working for me so i compiled them with python using a git clone in the folder
After joining the session was able to locate the user administrator and find Desktop
Used type to display text
