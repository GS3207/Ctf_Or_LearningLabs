Found portfolio.php in the source
Used that to run an sqlmap and it was injectable

dirb found a administrat page that opened up a login page
Trying to extract username and password from db to this
Str0ngP4ss was teh password for db_user
didnt work with common usernames and passwords
maybe run it against burp suite and common list
found safeadmin table
safeadm was the user and password didnt seem crackable
safeadm was a valid user in the login page
waiting for the dirb scan to complete
